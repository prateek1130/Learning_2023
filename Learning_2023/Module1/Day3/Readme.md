Level-1:

1. Patern Generator:
Write a program to print the given pattern below using 3 functions (1st to accept n and to print from 1 to n, 2nd to accept n and print spaces in between, 3rd to accept the n and print from n to 1)
1234554321
1234    4321
123        321
12            21
1                1

Concepts to be used.
- Loops

 

2. Prints Bits:
Scan a 32bit integer and prints its bits.

Concepts to be used.
- Loops
- Bitwise Operators

 

4. Find the largest number by deleting single digit in a 4 digit number 5872 - 872, 9856 - 986

Concepts to be used.
- Loops
- Operators

 

5. Write a program to find both smallest and largest digits in given n numbers
For example let's say we have n = 3, and n1 = 8, n2 = 156, n3 = 123450, the result will be "Not Valid", 1 and 6, 0 and 5
