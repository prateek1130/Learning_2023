Level-2:

 

1. Write a program to swap every alternate element of a given array starting for element 0
For example, let's say we have a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, the result should be a[5] = {30, 20, 10, 40, 50}
one more example a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}, the result should be a[5] = {30, 20, 10, 60, 50, 40}

Topics to be covered
- Arrays
- Loops
- Basic Operators

 

2. W.A.P to compare the items in a box, assume equal size boxes
Boxes shall have unique items stored in random order
Boxes are compared True if there is one to one mapping of items
return the final result 1 or 0

Example of Equal Boxes:
A[3] = {200, 10, -90}
B[3] = {-90, 200, 10}    

Example of Unequal Boxes:
A[3] = {200, 9, -90}
B[3] = {-90, 200, 10}    

Note: The array should not be sorted

3. Suppose 7 names are stored in an array of pointers names[] as shown below:
 char *name[]={
        "Santosh", "Amol", "Santosh Jain", "Kishore", "Rahul", "Amolkumar", "Hemant"
          }
  Write a program to arrange these names in alphabetical order.

 

4. Write a function xstrchr() which scans a string from beginning to end in search of a character. 
If the character is found, it should return a pointer to the first occurrence of the given character in the string.
If the given character is not found, the function returns a NULL.
The prototype of the function should be:

char *xstrchr(char *string, char ch):


5. Write a program to encode any given string such that it gets converted into an unrecognizable form. 
Also write a decode function to get back the original string.
