Level-1:

 

1. Write a program to print exponent part of double variable in hexadecimal and binary format.
lets say we have x = 0.7, the exponent in hex is 0x3FE and 0b01111111110

Topics to be covered
- Pointers
- Bitwise Operators


2. Write a program to swap any type of data passed to an function.

Topics to be covered
- Pointers
- Type Casting

 

3. Write a program to sum every alternate elements of a given array starting for element 0
For example, let's say we have a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, the result should be 10 + 30 + 50 = 90

Topics to be covered
- Arrays
- Loops
- Basic Operators

 

4. Write a program to find total number of bits set in a given array.
Say we have a array of 3 elements
a[3] = {0x1, 0xF4, 0x10001};
The total number of set bits in the given array is
1 bit in 0x01, 5 in 0xF4, 2 in 0x10001, so the total is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 bits
